<h5>Decide on Key <i>style</i></h5>
The format of the keys is configurable through
<code>ftp.keystyle=string|struct</code>. It can be a string with the file name, or a FileInfo structure with name: string and offset: long. The offset is always 0 for files that are updated as a whole, and hence only relevant for tailed files.
<hr>

<h5>Tail versus updates</h5>
Tailed files are only allowed to grow. Bytes that have been appended to it since a last inspection are yielded. Preceding bytes are not allowed to change;
Updated files can grow, shrink and change anywhere. The entire contents are yielded.<br/><br/>
To <code>tail</code> files in a remote location use:
<pre>
    connect.ftp.monitor.tail=ftpFolderX/*.csv:topicX,ftpFolderY/*.csv:topicY
</pre>
To <code>update</code> entire files in a remote location use:
<pre>
    connect.ftp.monitor.update=ftpFolderX/*.csv:topicX,ftpFolderY/*.csv:topicY
</pre>

<hr>
<h5>Decide how frequently to poll</h5>
This is defined via an iso8086 definition of time. For example to poll every 1 minute use:
<pre>
    connect.ftp.refresh=PT1M
</pre>
<hr>

<h5>Ignore old files</h5>
Usually when connecting into an FTP location you are mostly interested in files that became available in the past X days.
To speed things up and completely ignore files that have not changed the past 14 days use:
<pre>
    connect.ftp.file.maxage=P14D
</pre>
