    This connector provides a real time feed for new bitcoin blocks and transactions provided by www.blockhain.info<br>
    JSon events are then pushed into a Kafka topic.

    Since is a direct websocket connection the Source will only ever use one connector task at any point. There is
    no point spawning more and then have duplicate data.

    One thing to remember is the subscription API from blockchain doesnâ€™t offer an option to start from a given
    timestam. This means if the connect worker is down then you will miss some data.
    The Sink connects to unconfirmed transaction!! Read more about the live data
