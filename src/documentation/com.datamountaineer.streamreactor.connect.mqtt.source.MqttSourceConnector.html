<h5>Step 1: Decide on quality of service</h5>
QoS level is an agreement between sender and receiver of a message regarding the guarantees of delivering a message. There are 3 QoS levels in MQTT:
<ul>
    <li><b>0</b> - At most once</li>
    <li><b>1</b> - At least once</li>
    <li><b>2</b> - Exactly once</li>
</ul>
<pre>
    connect.mqtt.service.quality=2
</pre>

<h5>Step 2: Decide which fields we want to bring in </h5>
<pre>
    connect.mqtt.source.kcql=INSERT INTO position-reports SELECT * FROM /ais
</pre>

<h5>Step 3: Decide on authentication</h5>
The MQTT connector support user/pass based auth and also CA certificate based auth
