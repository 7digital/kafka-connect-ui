<h5>Step 1: Decide whether to use BULK or INCREMENTAL import mode</h5>
<ul>
    <li><b>Bulk</b> Each table is selected in full each time it is polled.</li>
    <li><b>Incremental</b> Each table is queried with lower and upper bounds to extract deltas.
        In incremental mode the column used to identify new or delta rows has to be provided.
    </li>
</ul>

<h5>Step 2: Fill in the KEY space where the Cassandra data live in</h5>

<h5>Step 3: Decide which fields are of interest and use KCQL to define them</h5>

To insert every single field from a Cassandra table into Kafka use:
<pre>
    connect.cassandra.source.kcql=INSERT INTO TOPIC1 SELECT * FROM TOPIC1 PK myTimeUUICol
</pre>
